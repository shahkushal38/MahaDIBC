## The project is based on the following problem statement - 

 A portal needs to be developed to facilitate district collectors to upload the
district specific problems, projects etc. The portal should be accessible to all
the institutes so that the students can select the problems as their project
work and submit solutions in the form of a report. The portal should have a
provision for online interaction between district Authorities (respective
department officials) and the concerned student group/Institute
